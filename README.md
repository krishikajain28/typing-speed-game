A fast, lightweight typing speed test built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Track your **Words Per Minute (WPM)** and **Accuracy** while racing against a **30‑second** timer.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The timer starts when you begin typing. 
2. Each character/word is validated in real time. (in every 1 second)
3. When time’s up or the sentence ends, WPM and accuracy are calculated.
   > ⏱️ The timer is set for **30 seconds**, and sentences are curated accordingly.
